Insertion sort
--------------

The insertion sort algorithm along with the pseudo code is provided in Section 2.1 of the book. We provide a function in C to implement an insertion sort and execute it to sort a randomly generated array of integers. To keep things simple we limit our computations to integers.

``` rcpp
#include <stdio.h>
```
