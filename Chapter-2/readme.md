# Introduction

This chapter loosely follows the book. Our codes are going to be in C++. We'll implement some of the examples and exercises, but we'll also go beyond. Example: We'll write a class of arrays to implement the sort algorithms in this chapter as member functions. But why stop there? Why not also implement other sort algorithms if we have already written a class

## A flexible array class with different sort methods:
